some lyrics are in the video (livestream+logic pro)

ya ey
ya ey
skip the 
x
way you got it
fucking called it
ya ey

(repeat the beginning)

bring morough
turn into a fucking hardass
your god 



let go for another layer
let go for another layer
let go for another layer
brooough

can you come back
can you come back you (now)

can't believe in second coming

don't you think it would make me remember

try to boast existing, kinda botched thought (prove existing)
believe in any other god, your god 
such a massive fan of churning (journey)
thank you, we're here, such a turn out (thank us) - change amount of words

kind of bonka, 
kill them all raw
let the blood get hard, 
in the sun, dead (ya)

i know of any other way 
hardwired ha, this is why
he can't hear you
he can't hear you bitch
he can't hear you bitch

got a little life, second pack n get it by
yank it, pin it up, burn up turning (burn up)
your little life too speck to track and count it up (raison de entre, track a cannibal) 
kindly let me brace for burning (kindly let me = sorta let down, sort the let down)
drop it right before i close your doubts (doors)

how come he abandoned us 
don't let it reach me again (?)
kinda loath him, now i
trust in anima

make it turn to dust 
make it turn it up
make it kinda love 
make it kinda love and
make it kinda love thy kind
embarking into a prophet words, 
on a mission
 
that's a cannibal
ha, done, pin it up

x
x
INSERT THE WOBBLY FLOW
kind of bonka
kill them all raw
let the blood get hard
in the sun, dead (ya)

i know of any other way 
hardwired ha, this is why
he can't hear you
x
x

can't throw another stone
at your god, 
this is your fault 
breaching you run it out
right now 
right now
right now

gotta crush the yearning
