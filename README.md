some lyrics are in the video (livestream+logic pro)

ya

trust

any other

any other way 

i can't hear you
i can hear you bitch
i can hear you bitch

got a little life 
second pack n get it by
yank it, pin it up
burn it turning

your little life too speck
to track a cannibal (raison de entre) 
kindly let me, brace for
burning, drop it right before i close your doubts

how come you abandoned me 
don't let it reach me again (?)
kinda loath you
trust in anima

make it turn to dust 
make it turn it up
make it kinda love 
make it kinda love and

make it kinda love thy kind
twisting into a prophet
