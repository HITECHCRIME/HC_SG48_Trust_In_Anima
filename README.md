some lyrics are in the video (livestream+logic pro)

ya

try to boast existing, kinda botched thought (prove existing)
believe in any other god, your god 
such a massive fan of churning (journey)
thank you, we're here, such a turn out (thank us) - change amount of words

kind of bonka
kill them all raw
let the blood get hard
in the sun, dead (ya)

i know of any other way 
hardwired ha, this is why
he can't hear you
he can't hear you bitch
he can't hear you bitch

got a little life 
second pack n get it by
yank it, pin it up
burn it turning (burn up)

your little life too speck
to track a cannibal (raison de entre) 
kindly let me brace for burning (kindly let me = sorta let down, sort the let down)
drop it right before i close your doubts

how come he abandoned us 
don't let it reach me again (?)
kinda loath him, now i
trust in anima

make it turn to dust 
make it turn it up
make it kinda love 
make it kinda love and
make it kinda love thy kind
embarking into a prophet words, 
on a mission
 
that's a cannibal
ha, done, pin it up

can't throw another stone
at your god, 
this is your fault 
breaching you run it out
right now 
right now
right now
